It can be used to automate tasks like generating code, architecture diagrams, and test cases, as well as to generate more complex output like website designs, automatically generated environments, real-time intelligent decision making for autonomous systems, and natural language processing for automatic documentation. Natural language processing can be used to assist with requirements analysis, translation, and natural language interface development."

        "Generative AI and Natural Language Processing can be used to create automated software products. These products can range from virtual assistants to search engines and recommendation systems. With generative AI, software products can better understand the user\u2019s input and generate output that meets the needs of the user. Natural Language Processing can be used to improve customer service by understanding customer conversations and providing personalized responses. These technologies are also being used to create more accurate and personalized advertisement campaigns. Additionally, these technologies can be leveraged to provide an interactive user experience with more natural and user-friendly interactions."

        "This slide is exploring why students may have difficulty adding on new features after they have already finished a course. Generally speaking, this is because a student may not have all the necessary resources or skills required to effectively add on new features to existing code. Additionally, a student may lack the understanding of the use case from their own experiences, making it difficult to implement new features correctly."

        "This slide is about using new technology in a project. It suggests that one should first understand the big picture of the technology they are working with (or a percentage of it) and its potential use cases. It could be helpful to compare it to a technology one already knows in order to get a better understanding. Additionally, it is important to take into consideration how the new technology will impact the product."

        "This slide describes how to break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. The idea is to set smaller, realistic goals and create a plan of action to achieve those goals, making the tasks less daunting and more achievable. By breaking tasks down into smaller parts, you can create a sense of direction and work on one part at a time until they all come together to form the bigger task."
