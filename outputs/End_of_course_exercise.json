        "Generative AI and software development are closely related. Generative AI can be used to create software that is able to autonomously generate complex and useful patterns and processes. Natural language processing can be used to allow developers to use natural language to interact with the software and command different actions, and can also be used in the creation of more user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, generative AI can be used to create new types of software solutions that may not have been possible without it, such as automating the creation of intelligent applications, machine learning models, and automated testing."

        "Generative AI and natural language processing can be used in a variety of software products to automate tasks. Natural language processing can be used to analyze texts or conversations, generate new texts, or interpret commands. Generative AI can be used to create new data from existing data and to develop models that can be used to make predictions. This could be used in software products for tasks such as automated customer support, natural language processing applications, personalized content curation, automated report generation, or other types of data mining applications."

        "This slide discusses the problem faced by students when features are added to their course after they have already worked on it. This puts students in a difficult situation, as they have to quickly adapt to the changes and relearn some aspects of the course, whether it be changes in the curriculum or how to use the tools they are given to effectively complete their projects. This situation arises because the use case of the course is not fully understood by the students until they have experienced it, leading to features being added after the course has started."

In software engineering, design review is the evaluation of the design documents or components of the system by qualified people other than the designers. It is also known as peer review as it helps to ensure that the design goals, product requirements, and other project-related deliverables are met. The design review process also ensures that the product meets the quality standards and conforms to the applicable standards and guidelines."
